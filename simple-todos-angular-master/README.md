#Simple Todos w/ Meteor and Angular

## What
This is Meteor's simple todos tutorial, using Angular in lieu of Meteor's
Blaze UI frontend. There is some additional tinkering I've done, and will
likely continue to do, as I learn my way around Meteor *and* Angular.

## Tinkerings
* Delete method protected && delete button hidden to non-owner users
* Added themeteorchef:bert package for alert popups
* Restructured directories to /server, /client, /lib model for source
* Added verification emails. Verification required to add or check off items.
